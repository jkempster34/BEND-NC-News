# Northcoders News API

Northcoders News is a website comprising of user-generated articles in a bulletin board system. This content can be discussed through comments, and each article or comment can be rated by means of a votes system. It was built as part of the Developer Pathway, a 12-week coding bootcamp at Northcoders in Manchester.

The back end layer of Northcoders News offers a CRUD based REST Web API built in Express.js and Node.js, with a postgreSQL database. All data should be received and sent in the JSON format.

The deployed back end can be found at: https://nc-news-joseph-kempster.herokuapp.com/api
